**Genre:** An action defence game.

**Platform:** Desktop only.

**Story:** Various Champions have just declared war on all Poros.  They are ready to fire all of their ultimate
    abilities at the helpless pile of Poros.  Braum jumps in and has taken it upon himself to protect the
    poros at all costs with his trusty shield.

**Esthetics:** The graphics will be images and textures from *League of Legends*.  The sound will mainly consist of
    explosions when Braum blocks the projectiles.  Also, there will be 8-bit sounds for incrementing score and
    letting a projectile hit the poros.

**Gameplay:** The player will move Braum up, down, left, and right, in order to move around the lane and body-block
    projectiles.  They can do this by using the WASD keys or the arrow keys.  Because of the simple controls and
    nature of the game, there will be a menu before the start button that explains the controls.  In order for
    players to get a high score, they must collect various power-ups, including health packs and size buffs.
    Here is an example of how the gameplay will be represented:

**Other:** As stated before, I will be using art and assets from *League of Legends*.  I will make that clear at the
    startup screen and will not take credit for Riot Games's art and assets.
